> _"Because reading your own documents is so 2022. Let the AI do the heavy lifting while you take all the credit. Now with 100% more dark mode!"_

## 😏 What Is This Masterpiece?

Welcome to **AI Document Analyst v2.0** – the tool you never knew you desperately needed, now with a complete UI makeover that'll make your other apps jealous. Built by _Devansh Singh_ (yes, I made this, and yes, I'm still waiting for my Nobel Prize).

This Python-powered, AI-infused, theme-switching, sarcasm-enabled agent will:

- **Read** your PDFs, DOCX, TXT, CSV, Excel, and even images (OCR, because why not?).
- **Summarize** them using Meta Llama models via Together AI (because free is better than expensive).
- **Analyze** your data with pandas wizardry (the Avengers of data science).
- **Visualize** trends and patterns with auto-generated charts (because you love pretty colors).
- **Chat** with your documents like they're your best friend (spoiler: they're more reliable).
- **Switch** between light and dark themes (because your eyes deserve options).
- **Generate Reports** that sound like you spent hours on them (you didn't).

All this, wrapped in a gorgeous Streamlit UI with tabs, themes, and more bells and whistles than a marching band.

## 🛠️ How to Run (Because Reading Instructions Is Actually Important)

### 1. **Install Requirements:**

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Or just install everything you see in the imports. I believe in your package management skills.)

### 2. **Run the App:**

```sh
python Data_Analyst_Agent.py
```

Or, if you're feeling fancy:

```sh
streamlit run Data_Analyst_Agent.py
```

### 3. **Open Your Browser:**

- The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:8502`
- If it doesn't, manually navigate there (I can't click for you)

### 4. **Start Analyzing:**

- The app includes a **free API key** (yes, FREE!)
- Just upload your files and start chatting
- No complicated setup required

---

## 🔑 API Key (Now 100% Free!)

**Good news!** I've decided to be generous and provide my own Together AI API key with the app. Why? Because:

- Together AI is essentially free for reasonable usage
- You shouldn't have to jump through hoops to try this
- I'm feeling charitable (it happens sometimes)

### But If You Want Your Own Key...

1. Get it from [Together AI](https://api.together.xyz/) (they're pretty cool)
2. Use the **Settings Tab** in the app to add your key
3. Or set it as an environment variable: `TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_key_here`

### Available AI Models:

- **Llama 3.1 8B Turbo** (Recommended - fast and efficient)
- **Llama 3.1 70B Turbo** (Powerful - for when you need the big guns)
- **Llama 3.2 11B Vision** (Multimodal - can see your images)
- **Mixtral 8x7B** (Alternative - because options are good)
- **Nous Hermes 2** (Conversational - optimized for chat)

## 🤖 How It Works (Magic, But With Science)

1. **🏠 Start at Home:** Overview of features and quick start guide
2. **📤 Upload Files:** Drag & drop your documents in the Upload tab
3. **🔄 Auto-Processing:** Text extraction, OCR, data loading - all automatic
4. **📊 Get Analytics:** Instant stats, charts, and insights in the Analytics tab

6. **⚙️ Customize:** Tweak settings, change themes, swap AI models
7. **📈 Export Results:** Screenshots, insights, whatever you need

- **Beautiful UI:** Dark mode, themes, modern design
- **Actually Smart:** Real AI analysis, not just fancy buttons
- **Multiple File Types:** PDF, Excel, images - it reads everything
- **Conversation Memory:** Ask follow-up questions like a normal human

- **Regular Updates:** I actually maintain this thing

## 🔧 Installation Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors (because software is never perfect):

### Numpy/Pandas Issues:

```bash
pip uninstall numpy pandas -y
pip install numpy==1.24.3
pip install pandas==1.5.3
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Streamlit Issues:

```bash
pip install --upgrade streamlit
```

### API Issues:

- The built-in API key should work automatically
- If not, get your own from [Together AI](https://api.together.xyz/)
- Add it in the Settings tab or as an environment variable
